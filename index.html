    <p>The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates
    </p>
    <h2> Habitat</h2>
    <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.

    <h2> Youth </h2>
    <p> Lion cubs are born blind; their eyes open around seven days after birth. They weigh 1.2–2.1 kg (2.6–4.6 lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age. To avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-one by the nape of the neck. Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old. When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs.
    </p>
    <h2> Diet </h2>
    <p>The lion is a generalist hypercarnivore and is considered to be both an apex and keystone predator due to its wide prey spectrum. Lions also hunt common warthog depending on availability, although the species is below the preferred weight range. In India, sambar deer and chital are the most commonly recorded wild prey, while domestic livestock may contribute significantly to their diet. They usually avoid fully grown adult elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamus and small prey like dik-dik, hyrax, hare and monkey. Lions kill other predators such as leopard, cheetah and spotted hyena but seldom consume them.

    <p>The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.
    </p>
    <h2> Habitat </h2>
    <p> In the Caucasus, Tigers inhabited hilly and lowland forests. On the Indian subcontinent, it inhabits mainly tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests and the swamp forests of the Sundarbans. In Laos, 14 tigers were documented in semi-evergreen and evergreen forest interspersed with grassland in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area during surveys from 2013 to 2017. In Sumatra, tiger populations range from lowland peat swamp forests to rugged montane forests.

    <h2> Youth </h2>
    <p>Litters consist of two or three cubs, rarely as many as six. Their milk teeth break through at the age of about two weeks. They start to eat meat at the age of eight weeks. They make short ventures with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. A dominant cub emerges in most litters, usually a male. The cubs start hunting on their own earliest at the age of 11 months, and become independent around 18 to 20 months of age. Young females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males at four to five years.
    </p>
    <h2> Diet </h2>
    <p>In the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized mammals, particularly ungulates weighing 60–250 kg . The most significantly preferred species are sambar deer, wapiti, barasingha and wild boar. They also prey on other predators, including dogs, leopards, pythons, bears, and crocodiles. When in close proximity to humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys.
